> AddToAnki, a Japanese pop-up dictionary extension for Chrome, like [yomichan](https://github.com/FooSoft/yomichan).
> Given that Yomichan is no longer under maintenance, I initiated this endeavor for my personal needs. 
> The project employs AI to substitute the conventional dictionary functionality. 
> However, it's worth noting that the AI's precision might not be on par with that of traditional dictionaries.

AddToAnki provides advanced features :
- Use AI to explain words 
- More nature audio  
- Automatic note creation for the Anki flashcard program via the [AnkiConnect](https://foosoft.net/projects/anki-connect/) plugin.
